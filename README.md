Overview

These C programs cover a variety of fundamental concepts including sorting algorithms, string operations, mathematical logic, data handling, and basic structure-driven input/output. The code is modular, beginner-friendly, and fully tested using GCC.

Program Categories

Sorting Algorithms

bubblesort.c – Implementation of Bubble Sort

insertionsort.c – Implementation of Insertion Sort

stringsort.c – Lexicographical sort for strings


Mathematical Logic

gcd.c – Calculates the Greatest Common Divisor using Euclidean method


String Operations

reverse_string.c – Reverses a given string


Structure-Based Programs

books.c – Manages book records using structures

census.c – Population data handling via structures

studentinfo.c – Basic student details management

studentmarks.c – Calculates and displays student marks

How to Run

You can run any of these programs using a C compiler like GCC:

gcc filename.c -o output
./output

Make sure to replace filename.c with the actual file name you wish to compile.
