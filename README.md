## 📖 About This Repository

This repository contains everything I learned in college about Data Structures and Algorithms. All programs are written by me and explained in my own words, reflecting my journey from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

My goal is to master the fundamentals through **clean, beginner-friendly code** that anyone can understand and learn from. Each program is crafted with clarity and simplicity in mind.

### 📁 Folder Mapping

- **`Basics/`** - Contains fundamental programs including basic sorting algorithms
- **`LinkedList/`** - Organized into Singly, Doubly, and Circular linked list implementations
- **`stacks/`** - Stack implementations and applications (palindrome check, infix/postfix conversion, Tower of Hanoi, etc.)
- **`Queue/`** - Various queue implementations (Basic, Circular, Priority, Double-ended)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Navigating the Repository

1. **Browse by Topic**: Each folder is organized by data structure or algorithm type
2. **Start with Basics**: If you're new, begin with the `Basics/` folder
3. **Progressive Learning**: Move from simple to complex topics (Basics → Linked Lists → Stacks → Queues → Trees → Graphs)

### Compiling and Running Programs

All programs are written in C and can be compiled using GCC or any standard C compiler:

```bash
# Navigate to the desired folder
cd Basics

# Compile a program
gcc filename.c -o output

# Run the compiled program
./output
```

**Example:**
```bash
gcc bubblesort.c -o bubblesort
./bubblesort
```
