## 📖 About This Repository

This repository contains everything I learned in college about **Data Structures in C**. All programs are written by me, reflecting my journey from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

My goal is to master the fundamentals through **clean, beginner-friendly code** that anyone can understand and learn from. Each program is crafted with clarity and simplicity in mind.

### 📁 Folder Mapping

- **`Basics/`** - Contains fundamental programs including basic sorting algorithms
- **`stacks/`** - Stack implementations and applications (palindrome check, infix/postfix conversion, Tower of Hanoi, etc.)
- **`Queue/`** - Various queue implementations (Basic, Circular, Priority, Double-ended)
- **`LinkedList/`** - Organized into Singly, Doubly, and Circular linked list implementations

## 🚀 How to Use

### Navigating the Repository

1. **Browse by Topic**: Each folder is organized by data structure or algorithm type
2. **Start with Basics**: If you're new, begin with the `Basics/` folder
3. **Progressive Learning**: Move from simple to complex topics (Basics → Linked Lists → Stacks → Queues → Trees → Graphs)

### Compiling and Running Programs

All programs are written in C and can be compiled using GCC or any standard C compiler:

```bash
# Navigate to the desired folder
cd Basics

# Compile a program
gcc filename.c -o output

# Run the compiled program
./output
```

**Example:**
```bash
gcc bubblesort.c -o bubblesort
./bubblesort
```
